# High Roller (crypto)

We \[sic\] recieved word that a criminal APT had developed their own method for generating secure asymmetric encryption keys. We were able to intercept emails between the group including encrypted comms, and a 7zip file. All we managed to find in the 7zip file they sent out was their public key, and the key generator. Can you decrypt the comms?

## Analysis

We can see from `BestEncrypt.py` basic RSA using random numbers generated by a process based on the current time.

```python
random.seed(int(time.time()))
p, q = getPrime(512, random.randbytes), getPrime(512, random.randbytes)
n = p*q
```

We can see from the file information within the .7z archive a timestamp as follows:

```bash
$ stat public_key.pem 
  File: public_key.pem
  Size: 356       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: 252,0	Inode: 109599763   Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/    user)   Gid: ( 1000/    user)
Access: 2024-09-21 10:40:57.326332769 +0100
Modify: 2024-08-18 23:07:49.000000000 +0100
Change: 2024-09-21 10:40:57.299331566 +0100
 Birth: 2024-09-21 10:40:57.299331566 +0100
```

We can convert this to a number of seconds as follows:

```bash
$ date -u -d "2024-08-18 23:07:49.000000000 +0100" +%s
1724018869
```

We should be able to use this to seed the prng and produce the same values of `p` and `q` by walking backwards a few minutes at most.

For `e` we can see that it is generated with random bytes from the same source as `os.urandom` therefore we will parse this known `e` from the .pem file as follows: 

```python
e = getPrime(512)
```

```python
public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
    """
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    MIHdMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4HLADCBxwKBgQCMdauT2revYJrutp7eqQfrMkse
    TqfgRdLlMddaVRxiG04qJneVtpzkeLQTZqniJWx5YsUwMDeISeQjmVkr2a+Ob9S8

    K9OCgOoZGfcjIHAcrM+w4AdF48NQELqttmKlcko6ock=
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    """.encode()
)

known_e = public_key.public_numbers().e
```

### Note

`getPrime`, even when given fixed bytes as in this case, may return different values depending on the version of `pycryptodome`. Therefore it is important to fix the version as follows:

```bash
$ pip3 install --force-reinstall -v "pycryptodome==3.10.4"
```

This is a mistake the task author made and is therefore not something players should be reasonably expected to have worked out. Some players did score the flag so I guess they got the right version or by enumerating versions.

## Solution

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from Crypto.Util.number import *
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from os import system
import random

# critically important to use this version or getPrime might not return 
# the same p and q as were used in the task!
#
# $ pip3 install --force-reinstall -v "pycryptodome==3.10.4"
#
